Authorization = Once user login Application determining ,what roles/access are assigned to the specific user
different ways of authentication
1) Basic Auth

Integrity - Application ensures data comes for the valid source and not modified in the process(Signatures helps in)

2 MORE IMPORTANT CONCEPT
1) CORS - Cross origin resource sharing(used when communication b/w different domain, browser not allow cors you have to enable it)
